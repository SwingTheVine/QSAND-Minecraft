This is a list of all locations that need their version changed when upgrading to a new Minecraft version.
The list is as follows:
* The GitHub branch that is pushed to
* The "latest version" shield in README.md
* The hyperlinks in the README.md file
* The "latest release" RegEx (in the URL payload) in README.md
* The "resources" section in README.md mentions the Minecraft version
* The "mcversion" variable in src/main/resources/mcmod.info
* The "acceptedMCVersions" variable in src/main/java/com/SwingTheVine/QSAND/ModInfo.java
* The "version incrementer" GitHub workflow. Around line 6
* The splash text
* The CONTRIBUTING.md file in the "Development Environment" section
* The hyperlinks in the CONTRIBUTING.md file
* The build.gradle file, obviously
* The bug report template on GitHub

This is a list of all locations that use the version, but update automatically.
This only applies after the versions have been changed in all locations in the list above.
The list is as follows:
* The "version incrementer" ANT. Specifically, the 3rd <target>.
* The build.gradle file (in some places)
