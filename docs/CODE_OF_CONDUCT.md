# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of "The Tipping Hat" and "QSAND Mod" communities is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all community members and the consequences of unacceptable behavior in the community.

We invite all those who participate in "The Tipping Hat" or "QSAND Mod" communities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open-source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming and friendly and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
 * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
 * Sustained disruption of community events.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can submit a report in our Discord.

## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues (i.e. GitHub, Discord, etc) as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior outside the scope of community activities when such behavior can adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
