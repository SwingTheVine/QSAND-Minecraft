<h2>How Versioning Works</h2>
<p>
  The versioning system for this mod follows the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning rules</a>. As such, it is formatted in an <code>X.Y.Z</code> format where:
  <ul>
    <li>X is the major version. This is incremented when a non-backward compatible update is pushed. This is for new features.</li>
    <li>Y is the minor version. This is incremented whenever I push to GitHub. This is for stable bug-fixes.</li>
    <li>Z is the patch version. This is incremented whenever I launch Minecraft to test a patch. This is for unstable bug-fixes/features.</li>
  </ul>
  The versioning system for names and releases of versions of this mod are formatted in an <code>A.B.C-X.Y.Z</code> format where <code>A.B.C</code> is the Minecraft version.
</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<details>
  <summary><b>Don't you have to use the same license as the Forge MDK? <sub>Click to expand</sub></b></summary>
  Nope! The Forge MDK is a software library licensed under the <code>GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1</code> (GNU LGPLv2.1). According to (section 2a of) that license, a work (Minecraft mod) based on the software library (Forge MDK) must be a software library itself in order for the license to carry over. Since this Project is not a software library, I can use a different license.
</details> 
<details>
  <summary><b>Why does the Project have two different licenses? <sub>Click to expand</sub></b></summary>
  There are multiple reasons.
  <ui>
    <li>First, I wanted developers looking to make their own mods to have a way to use this Project's media assets. We are programmers, not artists. Being able to reuse assets dramatically speeds up the process of creating a mod. The media assets may be of higher quality than what the developer can obtain. In this case, reusing the media assets would increase the quality of the mod and user experience.</li>
    <li>Second, I wanted content creators to be able to use the media assets to showcase the Project. Content creators usually run a risk of getting a DMCA violation for using a mod's media assets. Having a different license that allows them to use media assets eliminates that risk.</li>
    <li>Third, the media license explicitly states that trademark rights are not granted by the license (Section 2b2). This allows me to send DMCA violations to mods impersonating the Project whilst <i>simultaneously</i> allowing content creators and developers to use the Project's trademarks in a way that does not impersonate the Project. In addition, if development of the Project is permanently halted, it allows developers to use the media assets to make a faithful recreation of the Project and continue updating it to new versions of Minecraft.</li>
