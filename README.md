# Quicksand And Numerous Dungeons

## How versioning works
The versioning system for this mod follows the [Semantic Versioning rules](https://semver.org/). As such, it is formatted in an `X.Y.Z` format where:
* X is the major version. This is incremented when a non-backward compatible update is pushed.
* Y is the minor version. This is incremented whenever I push to GitHub.
* Z is the patch version. This is incremented whenever I launch Minecraft to test a patch.
